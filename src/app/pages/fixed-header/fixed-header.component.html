<div class="content">
  <h1>Fixed Header</h1>

  <p>The grid comes with fixed headers which makes it user-friendly since the user will not have to remember the column
    headers when scrolling down. In addition to this the user can also use the arrow buttons to scroll left and right to
    quickly scroll horizontally.</p>
