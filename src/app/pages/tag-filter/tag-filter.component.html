  <h1>Tag Filter</h1>

  <p>A tag filter is similar to a multi-select filter but is used if there are a very large number of possible
    values which cannot be displayed in a multi-filter's list of options. Eg: Social Security Numbers.
    A column with the type of 'string' or 'url' can contain this Tag Filter. Also the data types 'number' and 'currency'
    may contain a Tag filter, the only difference is, it only allow numbers to be added. To add this filter to a
    column it is essential to add filterType as <a routerLink="/columnsAndFilters/overview">'tag'.</a> A user can add
    multiple tags by pasting a comma separated string or copying cells from an excel file.
  </p>
  <p>Validations for adding tag filters include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A maximum of 5000 tags can be added.</li>
    <li>A single tag (string) may only contain a maximum of 30 characters.</li>
    <li>A single number tag may only contain a maximum of 9 characters.</li>
    <li>Number type tags cannot contain alphanumeric characters.</li>
    <li>The same tag cannot be entered again.</li>
    <li>If a comma separated string is pasted (multiple tags) the system will automatically remove duplicates and trim
      the surrounding spaces, then add the tags.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This is a sample filter object sent through the tag filter within the <a routerLink="/gettingStarted/introduction">filters array</a> in the grid request.
    Notice that when multiple values are sent through this filter, it goes as a comma separated string.</p>
